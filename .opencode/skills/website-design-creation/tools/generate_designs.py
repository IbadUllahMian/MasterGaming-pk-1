    Generate or regenerate website designs for user comparison.
    Creates up to 3 design options in parallel.

    The designs argument is a list of exactly 3 items (one per design slot).
    Each item is either a DesignSpec object or null:
    - DesignSpec: generate/regenerate that design
    - null: keep that design unchanged

    For the FIRST call after discovery, pass 3 DesignSpec objects all with
    remix=false. Each should have user_requirements that include the shared
    base requirements PLUS a per-design variation hint (e.g. style direction,
    layout preference, visual mood) to produce meaningfully different designs.
    Never copy platform-workflow directives into user_requirements — requests
    to create or compare N designs/variations/directions are fulfilled by this
    call itself; each builder sees only its own spec and will otherwise render
    that text as site content (e.g. a literal "design directions" page).

    For subsequent calls (edits), each DesignSpec should include only the
    change requests relevant to THAT specific design (not a shared message).
    Pass null for designs that should remain unchanged.

    Args:
        designs: List of exactly 3 items. Each is a DesignSpec or null.
            Example for initial generation (per-design variation):
