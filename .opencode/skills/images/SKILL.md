  Use this skill when a task works with the website's image assets — creating a
  new raster image, editing one, removing a background, finding an asset that
  already exists, turning a local file into a hosted image the site can embed,
  or embedding and transforming a hosted image URL. Examples: "create a hero
  image", "change this photo", "remove the background", "the team photo I
  shared earlier", "put this image on the site", "resize this image", "crop
  the hero", "trim the logo", "zoom in on this photo", and "serve a smaller
  format". Also use it when creating or redesigning a page whose photo,
  illustration, background art, texture, or logo slot has no suitable approved
  asset, even when the user did not explicitly ask for image work. Use
  `website-product-ui-library` for dashboards, charts, workflows, and other
  product UI that should be rendered as code.

# Images

Create, find, and manage the website's visual assets. This skill is globally
available to sandbox agents; no specialist-agent handoff is required. Image
work is done when the verification checks in rule 7 below pass and every
embedded URL came from a recipe response.

When the task explicitly requires a named image integration or runtime-catalog
discovery and `tool-discovery-execution` is available to this agent, load and
follow it; choose and run the image capability returned by that workflow. If
that skill is unavailable to this agent, use the shared image-route recipes
below and state that the named catalog path was unavailable. The shared recipes
also remain the default when the task does not require integration discovery.
Do not run both routes for one requested image.

## Brand and brief

1. Read user-confirmed brand, audience, and positioning context from the
   knowledge wiki—the application's stored brand facts—through
   `wiki-management`. For website imagery, also load the selected design spec
   with the recipe below when one exists.
2. Apply explicit visual direction from the current task. It overrides every
   source below.
3. For choices the task does not specify, use user-confirmed wiki facts. Never
   contradict them.
4. For remaining website-imagery details, use the selected design spec. Ignore
   any design-spec detail that conflicts with the current task or wiki facts.
5. State assumptions for any needed choice these sources do not cover; do not
   present an assumption as established brand.
6. Define the concept before generating: message, visual motif, image or
   illustration treatment, channel, aspect ratio or dimensions, copy constraints,
   and required variants. Do not change the brief's audience, claim, or call to
   action while interpreting it visually.
7. After generation, verify that dimensions and format match the request; the
   intended subject and required text are fully inside the frame; rendered text
   exactly matches the requested copy; and colors and style do not conflict with
   confirmed wiki facts. Confirm each CDN URL returns a successful response. For
   every missing or failed variant, report its name and the returned status or
   error message.

If a visual must be placed into a page and the current agent cannot edit the
website, delegate placement to `web-developer` through `work-delegation` with
the chosen URL, crop or safe-area notes, and acceptance criteria.

## Assets extracted from reference websites

For every image task, inspect the application workspace's extracted assets
first:

```bash
APP_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
if [ -f "$APP_ROOT/docs/extracted_media.json" ]; then
  cat "$APP_ROOT/docs/extracted_media.json"
fi
```

Run this before inspecting website source, searching stored assets, generating
an image, or deciding that no matching asset exists. The file is the persisted
output for real images observed on a reference URL the user asked to reuse.
Apply this check even when the user does not mention the import again.

```
{
  "url": "https://reference-site.example",
  "extracted_at": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
  "images": [
    { "url": "https://...", "role": "hero|product|team|customer-logo|...", "context": "one-sentence description" }
  ]
}
```

- Select an extracted image only when its `role` matches the slot type and its
  `context` describes the same subject or business entity as the section. A
  generic hero photo does not replace a product image merely because both are
  wide.
- The user's explicit request for a new or generated image overrides the
  extracted-image preference. Otherwise prefer a matching extracted image. If
  none matches, do not modify `docs/extracted_media.json`; use the normal
  recipes below for that slot.
- Embed each chosen image by its `url` directly.
- If the file is missing, empty, or unreadable, fall back to the normal recipes
  below (uploads, generation).

The selection is complete when every requested image slot either has a matching
extracted URL or has been explicitly handed to the normal image flow.

Use the `bash` tool to call the platform's shared image routes. Pick the recipe by intent:

| Intent             | Use when                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `search`           | List what is already stored for this website — check here before generating or fetching.      |
| `generate`         | Create one or more new images (hero, product, logo, …). 1–10 images per call.                 |
| `edit`             | Modify an existing image referenced by URL.                                                   |
| `remove-background`| Make a transparent PNG of uploaded artwork — preserves the original pixels exactly.           |
| `upload`           | Turn a file on local disk (downloaded, captured, produced by another tool) into a hosted URL. |
| `design-spec`      | Read the website's imagery style / palette before composing prompts.                          |

Read [`references/prompt-authoring.md`](references/prompt-authoring.md) before
composing any `generate` or `edit` prompt. It contains mandatory rules for
required elements, text handling, ending sentences, and logo overrides; apply
every rule before submitting the image request.

## Hosted image URL transforms

Before embedding or transforming a hosted image URL—resizing, cropping, logo
trimming, format selection, zooming, or overlay composition—read
[`references/url-transforms.md`](references/url-transforms.md). It owns the URL
grammar, the logo-versus-content-image distinction, and the zoom-via-CSS
protocol. Validate transformed URLs with `scripts/check_urls.py` before
embedding them.

## Gotchas

- **Use `<<EOF`, never `<<'EOF'`.** Quoted heredoc terminators suppress shell variable expansion, so the platform receives the literal string `"$APPLICATION_ID"` and rejects it with a 422 UUID-parse error. Every recipe below relies on `$BACKEND_API_URL`, `$INTERNAL_API_TOKEN`, and `$APPLICATION_ID` being expanded by the shell before curl posts.
- **Pass `timeout: 300000` to bash for `generate` / `edit`.** A 10-image batch routinely takes more than the bash tool's 2-minute default; without the override the curl gets killed mid-flight and images never upload.
- **Embed the returned `url` directly.** It's a CDN URL already scoped to this application — no further upload step needed.
- **For normal generation or editing, always request a new slug.** Cloudinary's CDN caches by URL path. Re-uploading under the same `name` keeps serving the stale cached version to browsers for up to 30 minutes, even with `invalidate: true`. Pick a `name` that differs from every existing image slug—for example, append a content-derived suffix such as `-alt`, `-warm`, `-american`, or `-r1`—and use it in every HTML/JSX `src` reference written in this turn. **Exception: 504 recovery only.** Re-issue the same slug with `skip_if_exists: true` to retrieve an image already uploaded by the timed-out call, not to create a new one; see **Timeouts (504)**.

## Generate (1–10 images per call)

```bash
curl -sS -X POST "$BACKEND_API_URL/api/v1/internal/shared-tools/images/generate" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $INTERNAL_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @- <<EOF
{
  "application_id": "$APPLICATION_ID",
  "folder": "iter1",
  "message_id": "$OR_TRACE_MESSAGE_ID",
  "trace_node": "$OR_TRACE_NODE_NAME",
  "requests": [
    { "prompt": "wide-angle photo of a modern coworking lounge, warm lighting", "aspect_ratio": "16:9", "name": "hero-lounge" },
    { "prompt": "minimalist line-art logo of a mountain peak", "aspect_ratio": "1:1", "is_logo": true, "name": "brand-logo" }
  ]
}
EOF
```

Images upload to `app/<application_id>/<folder>/<name>` when `folder` is set, or `app/<application_id>/<name>` when omitted.

For more than 10 images, split the work into batches of at most 10 and emit
all independent `bash` calls in parallel in the same turn. Serialize batches
only when a later prompt depends on an earlier image. Do not use `task`
sub-agents for the batches.

Top-level fields:

- `application_id` (required) — application UUID.
- `folder` — optional subfolder for organizing uploads (e.g. an iteration ID like `iter1`). When set, images upload to `app/<application_id>/<folder>/<name>` instead of the flat `app/<application_id>/<name>`. **Must match the iteration ID embedded in `Image Base URL` so predetermined HTML `<img src>` URLs resolve.**
- `message_id` / `trace_node` — include on every `generate` call, always as the literal values `"$OR_TRACE_MESSAGE_ID"` / `"$OR_TRACE_NODE_NAME"` (the shell expands them; an empty value is fine). They attach the image generations to this run's observability trace.
- `skip_if_exists` — optional, defaults to `false`. Recovery-only flag: see **Timeouts (504)** under Errors. Leave it `false` for normal generation; to regenerate an image, leave it `false` and request a new slug (per the new-slug rule under Gotchas) rather than setting this flag.
- `quality` — `"premium"` serves a higher-quality model tier; use it for standalone creative deliverables (task runs — `$TASK_ARTIFACTS_DIR` set). Website page imagery stays on the default `"standard"`.

Per-request fields:

- `prompt` (required) — authored per the rules in `references/prompt-authoring.md`.
- `aspect_ratio` — one of `16:9 | 4:3 | 1:1 | 3:4 | 21:9`. Defaults to `16:9`.
- `is_logo` — `true` for a transparent-background logo.
- To place an **existing** exact logo onto a generated image, follow the overlay
  composition rules in `references/url-transforms.md` — image models cannot
  reproduce a brand mark exactly, so generate the visual without it and overlay
  the real file.
- `name` — optional filename. Must be unique in the batch and match `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]{0,63}$` (lowercase, digits, `-`, `_`). Becomes the last path segment of the returned Cloudinary URL. Auto-generated if omitted.

Response:

```json
{
  "images": [
    { "url": "https://static.kite.ai/…", "public_id": "app/…/hero", "prompt": "…", "aspect_ratio": "16:9", "width": 1920, "height": 1080, "bytes": 245678, "source": "image-generation-service" }
  ],
  "errors": [],
  "total_requested": 2, "total_succeeded": 2, "total_failed": 0
}
```

## Edit (1+ reference images)

```bash
curl -sS -X POST "$BACKEND_API_URL/api/v1/internal/shared-tools/images/edit" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $INTERNAL_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @- <<EOF
{
  "application_id": "$APPLICATION_ID",
  "reference_images": ["https://static.kite.ai/app/…/hero.png"],
  "prompt": "change the sky to a warm sunset",
  "aspect_ratio": "16:9",
  "is_logo": false,
  "name": "hero-sunset"
}
EOF
```

- `reference_images` (required, 1-10) — `http://` or `https://` URLs. Pass one for a simple targeted edit, multiple to combine, blend, or use as style references. Other URL schemes are rejected (422).
- `prompt` (required) — what to change.
- `aspect_ratio` — defaults to `1:1`; pass the source image's ratio explicitly to preserve it.
- `is_logo` — `true` if the source is a logo so the edit keeps a transparent background.
- `name` — optional, same rules as `generate`.

Returns `{ url, public_id, prompt, width, height, bytes }` for the edited image. Use `edit` whenever the existing image's pixels need to change. For pure background removal use `remove-background` — it preserves artwork pixel-for-pixel.

## Remove background (preserve original pixels)

For "remove the white background", "make it transparent", "isolate the logo" on uploaded or existing artwork. Output is a transparent PNG containing the original pixels — nothing is regenerated.

```bash
curl -sS -X POST "$BACKEND_API_URL/api/v1/internal/shared-tools/images/remove-background" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $INTERNAL_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @- <<EOF
{
  "application_id": "$APPLICATION_ID",
  "image_url": "https://static.kite.ai/app/…/uploaded-logo.png"
}
EOF
```

- `image_url` (required) — `https://` URL. Cloudinary URLs work best.

Response: `{ url, original_url, provider, bytes }`. Embed `url` directly.

## Search existing assets

List what is already uploaded for this website: user attachments, earlier
generations, extracted logos. An asset already on the site's CDN is always
preferable to generating or fetching a new one — check here first when the
user references an image they shared earlier or when you need the URL of an
asset produced earlier in the conversation.

In a team-task sandbox, `$APPLICATION_ID` is the task UUID, not the selected
website UUID. Resolve the target with `kite-websites list`, then search it with:

```bash
kite-websites assets <website_id>
```

Before generating a brand image, also inspect the team's prior task outputs:

```bash
find "/efs/team_$TEAM_ID/artifacts" -maxdepth 4 -type f -print
find "/efs/team_$TEAM_ID/artifacts" -maxdepth 3 -name artifact-meta.json -print -exec cat {} \;
```

Prefer a matching site asset, or a task artifact whose metadata contains a
complete `hosted_url`, over generating a replacement. Match the requested
subject and role; a merely similar image is not a substitute. Do not use the
shared `/images/search` request below on the task plane, and do not rebind
`APPLICATION_ID` to the selected website.

When this task produces a requested image deliverable, save it under
`$TASK_ARTIFACTS_DIR` and add its entry to
`$TASK_ARTIFACTS_DIR/artifact-meta.json`. Alongside the required `class` and
`label`, record a semantic `role` and the complete returned `hosted_url`,
including its format extension. Omit `hosted_url` when the file is not hosted;
never add a parallel hosted boolean.

Outside the team-task plane, use the shared website search route:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST "$BACKEND_API_URL/api/v1/internal/shared-tools/images/search" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $INTERNAL_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "application_id": "'"$APPLICATION_ID"'", "max_results": 30 }'
```

- `resource_type` — optional filter: `"image"`, `"video"`, or `"raw"`.
- `max_results` — 1–500, defaults to 30. Results come newest first.

Response: `{ total_count, resources, next_cursor }`. Each entry in
`resources[]` has:

- `url` — the CDN URL you embed
- `filename`, `format`, `bytes`, `width`, `height`
- `tags` — AI-generated content tags
- `context.custom.alt`, `context.custom.caption` — human-set metadata

The endpoint returns the website's whole folder; for keyword filtering (e.g.
"team photo") match client-side against filename, tags, alt, and caption — a
hit in any of those fields counts.

## Upload a local file

When an image exists only on local disk and the website must embed it — after
downloading, capturing, or producing it with another tool. (Images from
`generate` / `edit` / `remove-background` are already hosted; embed their
returned `url` directly, no upload step.)

```bash
curl -sS -X POST "$BACKEND_API_URL/api/v1/internal/shared-tools/images/upload" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $INTERNAL_API_TOKEN" \
  -F "application_id=$APPLICATION_ID" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/local/image.png" \
  -F "name=hero-image"
```

- `name` — optional slug, same rules as `generate` (`^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]{0,63}$`);
  derived from the file's name when omitted. The new-slug rule under Gotchas
  applies here too — re-uploading under an existing slug serves the stale
  cached version.
- `folder` — optional subfolder, same semantics as `generate`.
- Upload **raster files only** (PNG/JPG/WebP). For an authored SVG, rasterize
  it first (next section) and upload the PNG — the CDN's own SVG-to-PNG
  conversion garbles text (negative `letter-spacing` mirrors and clips glyphs).

Response: `{ url, public_id, filename, width, height, bytes }`. Embed only the
returned `url`; if the request fails, report the error and do not invent a URL.

## Rasterize an authored SVG

When a deliverable needs exact text or logo placement, authoring it as SVG is
fine — but the deliverable is always the PNG. The sandbox browser is the only
faithful rasterizer here (ImageMagick lacks an SVG delegate; the CDN's
converter mangles text), and it also resolves remote `<image href>` logos:

```bash
kite-browser create "file://$PWD/visual.svg" && \
  kite-browser set viewport 1080 1080 && kite-browser wait 400 && \
  kite-browser screenshot --full /tmp/visual.png && kite-browser close
```

Set the viewport to the SVG's own `width`/`height` attributes so the capture
is 1:1. Then upload `/tmp/visual.png` with the recipe above and verify the
returned CDN URL renders the text correctly.

## Get design spec (imagery style + palette context)

```bash
curl -sS -X POST "$BACKEND_API_URL/api/v1/internal/shared-tools/images/design-spec" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $INTERNAL_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "application_id": "'"$APPLICATION_ID"'" }'
```

Response: `{ application_id, iteration_id, design_spec, source_filename }`. The `design_spec` field is the markdown body of `design_spec.md` (or `visual_spec.md` fallback) for the website's currently selected iteration. A `404` with `code: no_iteration_selected` means the design hasn't been selected yet — proceed without spec context.

## Errors

- `401` — `INTERNAL_API_TOKEN` missing or wrong. Check the env, stop retrying.
- `404` (design-spec only) — `no_iteration_selected` or `design_spec_not_found`: the website has no selected iteration, or no `design_spec.md` / `visual_spec.md` written yet. The endpoint is healthy; carry on without spec context. `application_not_found` or `missing_creator` instead means the scope itself is wrong — report it and stop.
- `422` — body schema error (missing `application_id`, >10 requests, bad `aspect_ratio`, non-http URL, empty or malformed `upload` file/slug). Fix locally, don't retry blindly.
- `502` (remove-background only) — provider rejected the image or timed out. Safe to retry once.
- `504` (`generate`) — gateway timeout; the image often generated anyway. Recover via **Timeouts (504)** below rather than a plain retry.
- other `5xx` — upstream model hiccup. Safe to retry once; if it fails again, surface the error to the user.

### Timeouts (504)

A `504 Gateway Time-out` on `generate` means the gateway stopped waiting (~60s) while the backend kept generating and uploading. Recover by reclaiming the finished uploads:

1. Wait 2 minutes (`sleep 120`) so the in-flight generation can finish uploading, premium images can take longer.
2. Re-issue the **same** request (same `application_id`, `folder`, and `name`s) with `"skip_if_exists": true`. Tool will respond with images uploaded in the previous request.
3. On another `504`, repeat the wait and re-issue up to twice more (never more than 7 minutes) before reporting failure.

The recovery request must carry `skip_if_exists` after a wait. Immediate re-issue will cause a re generation of the same prompts and cause 504 again.

Set `skip_if_exists` only for this recovery case. To create a fresh image — including when the user asks to regenerate something they can already see — call `generate` normally (with `skip_if_exists` omitted) and request a new slug, per the new-slug rule under Gotchas.
