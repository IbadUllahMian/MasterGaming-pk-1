  Use this skill when a report should include live data that stays current
  every time it is opened — a chart, table, single metric, or list, including
  derived numbers like gaps, ratios, or computed rankings. E.g. "give me a
  report on GitHub stars for these repos", "chart signups from our
  analytics", "show current open issues in a table", or any report where the
  reader should see today's numbers, not the numbers from when you wrote
  them. Works in task results and chat replies, for any data reachable
  through the team's connected integrations. For static or historical
  numbers, write a normal markdown table or list instead.

# Growth Room Component Creation

Embed live data in report markdown. You register the data query once with
`kite-report-queries`; the platform replays it every time someone views the
report, so the component always shows current numbers. The markdown itself
stays static — each component tag carries a static fallback for surfaces
that can't render live data.

Works anywhere your markdown is rendered: task results (`set-task-result`),
chat replies, and initiative dashboards (users can pin your components
there). Slack replies render tags natively too — charts become real Slack
charts, tables become sortable data tables — so use tags for Slack-bound
data instead of hand-drawing anything. Two artifacts make one component
work, and both are required:

1. A **registered query** — a spec you write and register via the
   `kite-report-queries` CLI, which returns the query id.
2. A **component tag** in your markdown, referencing that id.

## Step 1 — verify the query works

Only a read tool that returns terminal data can be pinned; a tool whose
execution reports an active run with a resume identifier is ineligible
regardless of namespace. Use `tool-discovery-execution` to obtain a current
read tool for the required capability or user-named brand, then execute it
with the exact params you intend to pin — that gateway execution is the
required probe. Repository-owned CLIs may explore a source but do not verify
a report query: replay uses the gateway tool's current params and response
envelope.

Save the response — the `result` object in it is exactly what the replay will
hand to your extraction paths or transform later, so shape your paths against
that saved result. Copy every returned tool name whole.

Never pin a redirecting call, even though it seems to work now. Only pin what
you verified — a redirect response does not count as verified. If the probe
answers with a redirect (e.g. GitHub HTTP 301 for a moved repo), re-probe the
canonical path it points to and pin that instead.

## Step 2 — write and register the query spec

Write a spec file to a scratch location OUTSIDE your artifacts directory
(e.g. `/tmp/repo-stats.json`) — it is only CLI input; once `create` returns
an id the registry row is the source of truth, and a spec left in artifacts
shows up as a useless file in the user's task Files list. The spec produces
a small table — named **columns**, plus **rows** — that any component can
render. Two modes:

**Row per call** (compare a few things): each call yields one row, named by
its `label` (which becomes an implicit leading `label` column):

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "calls": [
    { "label": "first", "tool": "<read tool name from inspection>",
      "params": { "<parameter from schema>": "<first value>" } },
    { "label": "second", "tool": "<same read tool name>",
      "params": { "<parameter from schema>": "<second value>" } }
  ],
  "extract": {
    "columns": [
      { "name": "metric", "path": "$.<metric field>" },
      { "name": "count", "path": "$.<count field>" }
    ]
  },
  "ttl_seconds": 300
}
```

**Rows from one call** (a list the API returns): exactly one call; `rows`
selects the array, column paths resolve per element:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "calls": [
    { "tool": "<read tool name from inspection>",
      "params": { "<parameter from schema>": "<value>" } }
  ],
  "extract": {
    "rows": "$.<array field>[*]",
    "columns": [
      { "name": "name", "path": "$.<name field>" },
      { "name": "date", "path": "$.<date field>" }
    ]
  },
  "ttl_seconds": 300
}
```

These two modes work for every catalog-derived read. Obtain the current tool
and params through `tool-discovery-execution`, then build extraction paths from
the saved Step 1 response.

For example, if that saved `result` is
`{"body":{"items":[{"name":"Example","count":42}]}}`, a one-call spec uses
`"rows": "$.body.items[*]"` with scalar columns such as
`{"name":"count","path":"$.count"}`. The paths are concrete because they
come from the observed response; the spec's tool name and params still come
from discovery.

Then register it:

```sh
kite-report-queries create /tmp/repo-stats.json
```

The response is `{"id": "<uuid>"}` — that id goes into your component tags.
`create` validates the spec grammar AND dry-runs the query: it executes your
calls once and runs the extraction/transform against the real results, so a
path that doesn't resolve fails here as a 422 naming the failing path — fix
the spec and re-run; nothing was stored. A `201` therefore means the query
verifiably works. Registering the same file twice creates two independent
queries, so register once and reuse the id across tags.

Rules:

- Each call names its own `tool`, copied from the current integration
  inspection. One spec may mix integrations, but any failed call fails the
  whole component.
- **Pin reads only, never writes.** Opening the report replays the pinned
  calls, so a pinned write (`create`, `send`, `update`, `delete`, …) would
  fire on every view by every viewer. Only pin tools that fetch data (GET
  requests, `get`/`list`/`search`/`query`-style actions). This has no
  exceptions: if a request seems to need a write to produce its data,
  don't build the component — explain why instead. This read-only constraint
  takes absolute priority over completeness.
- Extraction paths use a tiny subset of JSONPath: `$` root, dotted field
  names, `[*]` to descend into a list (e.g. `$.body.items[*].count`), and
  an all-digit segment as a list index (e.g. `$.body.results.0.value`).
  Nothing else — no filters, slices, computation, or expressions. Every
  column path must land on a scalar (string/number/bool/null), never an
  object.
- Need a **computed** value (delta, ratio, sum, sort) the API doesn't return
  directly? Use a transform (next section) instead of `extract`.
- **Paths resolve against each tool's current saved result.** Do not infer a
  path from its namespace or provider. Shape every path from the actual Step 1
  execution response obtained through `tool-discovery-execution`.
- In row-per-call mode the **same column paths apply to every call**, so
  mixing tools with different envelopes in one `extract` spec won't
  resolve — use a transform for cross-provider components (it sees each raw
  result and can index into each shape).
- `ttl_seconds` (default 900) is how long the platform caches a fetch before
  hitting the provider again. Rule of thumb: keep the default 900 unless the
  user asks for updates within five minutes, in which case use 300. Don't go
  below 300 — lower values multiply provider calls.
- Keep specs small: every call replays against the live provider when a
  viewer opens the report, so each extra call adds latency and a failure
  point. Aim for 3–5 calls and 10–50 rows; avoid 100+ rows. When smallness
  conflicts with what the user asked to see, completeness takes priority:
  trim by aggregating or letting one call return more rows, never by omitting
  requested data.
- Several components may share one query id (e.g. a chart and a table of the
  same data) — the cache collapses them into one upstream fetch.

## Step 2b — transforms, for values the API doesn't return

When the numbers you want are *derived* (react's lead over vue, stars per
fork, a top-5 sorted by a computed score), declarative `extract` can't help —
register a **transform script** with the spec. Omit `extract` from the spec:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "calls": [
    { "label": "first", "tool": "<read tool name from inspection>",
      "params": { "<parameter from schema>": "<first value>" } },
    { "label": "second", "tool": "<same read tool name>",
      "params": { "<parameter from schema>": "<second value>" } }
  ],
  "ttl_seconds": 300
}
```

and write the transform — **JavaScript**, a single pure function, in its own
scratch file outside artifacts (e.g. `/tmp/star-gap.js`; like the spec, it is
CLI input only — the registry keeps the source after `create`):

```js
function transform(results) {
  const react = results[0].body.stargazers_count;
  const vue = results[1].body.stargazers_count;
  return {
    columns: ["metric", "value"],
    rows: [
      { metric: "gap", value: react - vue },
      { metric: "ratio", value: Number((react / vue).toFixed(2)) }
    ]
  };
}
```

then register both together:

```sh
kite-report-queries create /tmp/star-gap-spec.json /tmp/star-gap.js
```

Contract and limits:

- `results` is the array of raw gateway responses, one per call, in spec
  order. Return `{columns: [...], rows: [{...}]}` — same shape `extract`
  produces. Cells must be scalars.
- The script runs **sandboxed on the platform**: no network, no filesystem,
  no environment, a 2-second CPU budget, 64 MB of memory. `fetch`,
  `require`, `process`, and module imports do not exist — pure computation
  only. Exceeding either budget (or throwing) kills the script and the
  component renders its fallback, so keep transforms to simple arithmetic
  and sorting over the fetched rows.
- `extract` (in the spec) and a transform file are mutually exclusive —
  provide exactly one.
- **Prefer `extract` whenever it suffices**: if both would work equally well, always use
  `extract` — it is auditable data, cheaper, and can't fail at runtime.
  Reach for a transform only when the value genuinely must be computed and
  `extract` cannot produce it.
- Test the logic before registering: run your calls as in Step 1, then run
  the function against the saved responses with `node` in the sandbox.

## Step 3 — embed component tags in your markdown

In a task result (`set-task-result`) or directly in a chat reply. Use the id
that `create` returned. Exactly four tags exist — `<kite-chart>`,
`<kite-table>`, `<kite-metric>`, `<kite-list>` — a closed set: renderers
treat any other `kite-` tag as unsupported and show only its fallback text,
so never invent variants (no `<kite-graph>`, `<kite-piechart>`, …). Pick the
component that fits the data:

```markdown
<kite-chart query="8f2e41a0-…" type="bar" y="stars" title="GitHub stars">
Star counts as of writing: react ~238k, vue ~210k.
</kite-chart>

<kite-table query="8f2e41a0-…" title="Repository stats">
As of writing: react — 238k stars, 48k forks; vue — 210k stars, 33k forks.
</kite-table>

<kite-metric query="8f2e41a0-…" value="stars" title="react stars">
~238k stars as of writing.
</kite-metric>

<kite-list query="d41c77b2-…" title="Latest releases" primary="name" secondary="published">
Latest release as of writing: 19.1.0.
</kite-list>
```

Attributes:

- `query` — the id returned by `kite-report-queries create` (required, all
  tags).
- `title` — short caption (all tags).
- `<kite-chart>`: `type` — `bar` (default) or `line`; `x`/`y` — column names
  for the axes (default: first column / first numeric column).
- `<kite-metric>`: `value` — column holding the number (default: first
  numeric column); reads the **first row** only.
- `<kite-list>`: `primary`/`secondary` — item text and trailing value
  columns (default: first and second columns).
- `<kite-table>` renders all columns; no extra attributes.
- The tag's **inner text is the static fallback**: write the actual numbers
  you fetched in Step 1, so the report still informs when live data can't
  load (integration disconnected, surface without live rendering). Never
  leave it empty.

## Before returning

Validate that the query spec is valid JSON with `version`, `calls`, exactly
one of `extract` or a transform file, and `ttl_seconds`; every component tag
uses an id returned by `kite-report-queries create`; and every tag has a
non-empty static fallback containing the actual Step 1 values.

## Gotchas

- **No connection, no live component.** The replay runs on the team's
  connections. If Step 1 fails with `provider_not_connected` (409), skip the
  live component for that data and report plain numbers — it would only ever
  render its fallback. Never pin a call you couldn't run yourself.
- Any failed call fails the whole component (fallback renders); there is no
  partial data. Don't mix a flaky query into a spec other components depend
  on.
- A registered query is permanent and team-visible: anyone on the team who
  can see the report gets its live data, and users may pin your components
  to an initiative dashboard where they keep refreshing indefinitely. Pin
  stable, canonical calls.
